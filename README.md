``BO-KM`` (available at the URL: https://github.com/baiweiphys/BO-KM/) is a new tool developed by Wei Bai and Huasheng Xie. Its primary objective is to efficiently calculate all solutions for the dispersion relation of obliquely propagating waves in magnetized hot plasmas with multiple species. This code provides extensive support for a wide range of distribution functions, including anisotropic drift kappa-Maxwellian distributions, anisotropic drift bi-Maxwellian distributions, and their combinations. Additionally, it can also handle bi-kappa distributions for perpendicular propagation.

## BO-KM

``BO-KM`` is a comprehensive code that has the capability to simultaneously solve for all significant roots of the dispersion relation for obliquely propagating waves in magnetized multi-species plasma. The code supports various distributions, including anisotropic drift kappa-Maxwellian distributions, anisotropic drift bi-Maxwellian distributions, and a combination of both (as well as bi-kappa distributions for perpendicular propagation). The ``BO-KM`` solver provides a powerful and efficient tool for analyzing the waves and instabilities in magnetized multi-species plasma with anisotropic drift kappa-Maxwellian, bi-Maxwellian distributions, or a mixture of both.

Input: The background magnetic field is denoted as $B_0$ (in Tesla), the angle of oblique propagation is represented as deg (in degrees), $J$ is a non-negative integer for $J$-pole expansion, $N$ is a non-negative integer for Bessel functions, and nk indicates the number of grid points.
The ``bokm.in`` file requires the following input parameters: $q_s$ (charge of species in elementary charge units), $m_s$ (mass of species in terms of electron mass), $n_s$ (number density of species in cubic meters), $T_{\parallel s}$ (parallel temperature of species in electron volts), $T_{\perp s}$ (perpendicular temperature of species in electron volts), $u_{s_0}/c$ (species drift velocity normalized by the speed of light), $\kappa$ (value of kappa for the distribution function of the $s$-th particle species), and $\kappa_{s,th}$ (threshold value for kappa).

We present seven benchmark examples that serve as representative cases, including the Multi-species bump-on-tail mode, EMEC waves, Bernstein waves, Whistler waves, Mirror mode, and EMIC waves.

At present, only Matlab version of ``BO-KM`` is available, which has been tested in MacOS and Windows 11 under Matlab 2023b.

## How to run the code:

1. 1. Set input parameters in the file ``BO-KM/RUN/case_XXXX/bokm.i``.
2. Set the parameters of ``N``, ``J``, ``deg`` (propagation angles, in degrees), and ``B0`` (background magnetic field in the z direction) in the file ``BO-KM/RUN/case_XXXX/main_bokm.in``.
3. After seting the above parameters in ``main_bokm.m``, run it. You can see some plots of the results. And all results will be stored in output directory. You can modify the plot section in the file  for different plots, or writing your own plot files.
4. After setting the above parameters in the file ``main_bokm.m``, run it. You can see some plots of the results. Additionally, all the output will be saved in the ``output`` directory. If you wish to customize the plots, you can modify the corresponding section in the file or create your own plot files.
